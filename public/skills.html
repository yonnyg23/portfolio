  <h3>HTML & CSS</h3>
  <text>
    I had started my journey with HTML in 2020, with a web-design course that taught me the basics of HTML.
    I designed some basic webpages, however I didn't understand how to use CSS at the time. With this current internet arcitechture course,
    I feel comfortable already with CSS and am looking to continue learning how I can style and manipulate webpages to look how I would want.
    My next focus for front end design is learning and using JavaScript.

  <h3>Java</h3>
  <text>
    I had started using Java in my intro to programming course taught in fall semester 2021. The course had begun with object-oriented concepts such as classes, methods, variables, arrays etc.
    Then I had my first assigmnent, a bank account. I had to implement all the concepts mentioned previously in order to make the bank account succesful. I had also developed a student grading system during this introductory course.
    Later on, in second semester, I had to use JavaFX in order to create a canadian income tax calculator project. This helped me understand how to implement GUI with Java, however I would rather develop an application with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS
    as it is easier for me.

  <h3>MySQL</h3>
  <text>
    I had starting learning SQL through my intro to databse course. First, I started off learning the logical design and structure such ass entities, relationships,
    keys, etc. Then I had gotten into MySQL workbench and focused on DDL and DDM, through class labs such as using select statements to get data from tables. Databases is the
    subject that comes easiest to me because of its logic and straightforward syntax. I hope to get into powerBI in the future in order to see the full power of the database.

  <h3>Android Studio</h3>
  <text>
    AndroidStudio is the software newest to me as I have just started learning it this semester. I have had fun developing simple mobile apps up to this point and
    hope to learn more in the future.
