<h1>Interests</h1>

<div class="content">
  <h3>Basketball</h3>
  <text>Basketball was my favourite sport as a kid growing up as I had played it at school , with friends etc. Right now I enjoy watching
    and following the NBA and my favourite team is the San Antonio Spurs.</text>
  <h3>Playstation 5</h3>
  <text>
    Ever since I was a kid I had played video games. My first console was a PSP, and from then on I had the Playstation 3 and every version since.
    I am currently enjoying the PlayStation 5 and see myself playing video games in the future.

  <h3>Gym</h3>
  <text>I started going to the gym this past summer as I felt it was time to improve my physique. I've been going consistently
    and hope to continue as working out will help my health later on in life.
  </text>
  <h3>Music</h3>
  <text>
    I have always liked listening to music as it brightens up the mood. When I was younger I listened to pop music and as I got older
    am listening to more rap and R&B.
